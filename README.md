# Comparisons of LLMs to Reinforcement Learning Models on File Fragmented Datasets 

#### As technology continues to improve along with the threat of cybercrime, it is important that we adapt and find strategies to prevent cybercrime from occuring. In this repo, I analyze two forms of ML in order to determine which one will be the most useful in Digital Forensics:

- ###### Large Language Models
- ###### Reinforcement Learning Models

#### I modified the original file fragmented datasets to scramble the name, as the names already revealed the label. Then from there I created a mapping to the original file type and file name in mappings.json

#### I used a Confusion Matrix and a F1 Score as the Metrics
